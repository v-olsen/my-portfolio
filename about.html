                The first language I learned was MATLAB. Ever since, I have been interested in teaching myself programming on my own. It wasn't until recently that I decided to take it to the next level and joined an Engineering Immersion bootcamp offered by Thinkful.

                Other passions of mine are music and fishing. I am self taught in music and am always looking for growth in my musical abilities. Additionally, I love the peacefulness of waiting for a bite on the hook.
